**Here's how to uninstall Edge**

If you installed Microsoft Edge by downloading the browser manually, rather than it installing automatically through Windows Update, you should be able to uninstall it using the following simple method. 

1. Open the Settings app in Windows 10 by clicking the Start button and selecting the gear icon. When the Settings window opens, click Apps.


2. In the “Apps & features” window, scroll down to “Microsoft Edge.” Select that item and click the Uninstall button. If this button is greyed out, sadly you’re out of luck and will need to use an alternative method.  


3. If you’ve installed the Beta, Developer, or Canary version of Edge, you'll be able to click Uninstall to remove the program. However, you’ll still be stuck with the latest stable version of Edge.
